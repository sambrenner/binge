    <phrase speaker="Valerie Chen">It was hard to, like... each person you had to teach them how to flip the cart, and tell them "don't do anything yet" in the intro animation, 'cause they were trying to do shit.</phrase>
    <phrase speaker="Sarah Rothberg">Yeah, I feel mixed about that, how that ended up.</phrase>

    <phrase speaker="Valerie Chen">And then flipping the cart, and then... you kind of had to just walk them through how it worked, like, "oh, you need to go through the cashiers' lines, any of them, but not the other way." They would like to go through the one that's, like, not a cashier, it's, like, the welcome guy. Or they would go on the wrong side of the other - the first - one. [I'd] be, like, "no, back up, back up." And it was really hard for people to steer, so it would be really hard for them to get into the lane.</phrase>
    <phrase speaker="Sarah Rothberg">3D is confusing for people.</phrase>
